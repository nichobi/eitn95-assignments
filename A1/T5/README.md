### Little's law:
 N = λ * T

- N: Mean number of customers in the system
- λ: Mean numbers of arrivals per second
- T: Mean time spent in the system for a customer

### Average server utilization
 ρ = λ/(cμ)

- ρ: Utilization of the server; also the probability that the server is busy or the
proportion of time the server is busy
- c: Number of servers in parallel
- μ: Mean service rate and equals to 1/E[Service-Time]

### 0.11:
 ρ = (1/0.11)/(5*(1/0.5)) = 0.9090909090909092

### 0.15
 ρ = (1/0.15)/(5*(1/0.5)) = 0.6666666666666667

### 2.0
 ρ = (1/2.0)/(5*(1/0.5)) = 0.05
