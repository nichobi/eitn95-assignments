# Results for Task 2
The results were put into this file since I didn't have access to the .docx document =(.

- 1. Approximately 0.8.
- 2. Approximately 0.8, but there is a greater variance.
- 3. Approximately 0.75.
- 4. 
  - 2) The reason that we get a greater variance in the result is explained by how the arrivals are now more varied. Regarding the mean value there should be no difference since on average the load is the same.
  - 3) The reason that we get a smaller mean value for task 4 is partly that the serving time for A is shorter compared to the B jobs, so when the queue fills up we save time on average by clearing out the A jobs first and then doing the slower jobs.
