1.
  10%:
    Mean queueing time, regular: 9.6 minutes
    Mean queueing time, priority: 3.5 minutes

  20%:
    Mean queueing time, regular: 11.5 minutes
    Mean queueing time, priority: 3.3 minutes

  50%:
    Mean queueing time, regular: 13.1 minutes
    Mean queueing time, priority: 4.1 minutes

2.
  10%:
    Max queueing time: 45.3 minutes

  20%:
    Max queueing time: 48.3 minutes

  50%:
    Max queueing time: 63.8 minutes

  As seen here, an additional cashier would be required to ensure no one waited more than 15 minutes, no matter what the probability of prioritised customers is.

When using shorter simulation lengths, the mean queueing times are approximately the same, but the maximum times are noticeably shorter.
