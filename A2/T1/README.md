# Task 1

## 1) How long is approximately the transient phase?
Approximately 100 seconds.


## 2) How long is the transient phase now?
Approximately 10 seconds.


## 3) How long is the transient phase in this case?
Approximately 200 seconds.


## 4) Find the length of the 95 % confidence interval.
Interval length for test 4 (T=4, M=1000): 0.3678158

## 5) How long will the confidence interval be? Explain the result.
Interval length for test 5 (T=1, M=4000): 0.2025689


## 6) How long is the confidence interval? Explain the result.
Interval length for test 6 (T=4, M=4000): 0.1926397

The distribution and confidence interval for subtask 4-6 stays the same, the only thing that increases is the sample size. Since we increase the sample size by 4x for subtasks 5-6 the interval should be decreased by $\frac{\sqrt{4n}}{\sqrt{n}} = 2$ times, which it roughly is. For subtask 5 and 6 we can see that the time between samples does not affect the interval.
