# Task 1

## 1) How long is approximately the transient phase?
Approximately 100 seconds.


## 2) How long is the transient phase now?
Approximately 10 seconds.


## 3) How long is the transient phase in this case?
Approximately 200 seconds.


## 4) Find the length of the 95 % confidence interval.
The minimum and maximum thresholds are 29-52 which gives a length of 23.95% of the time the amount of customers will vary from the mean by 23/2 customers.


## 5) How long will the confidence interval be? Explain the result.
The minimum and maximum thresholds are 28-53 which gives a length of 25. The length remains roughly the same but the interval seems slightly larger.


## 6) How long is the confidence interval? Explain the result.
The minimum and maximum thresholds are 28-53 which gives a length of 25. It seems like increasing the time between measurements does not affect the variance of the measurements.
